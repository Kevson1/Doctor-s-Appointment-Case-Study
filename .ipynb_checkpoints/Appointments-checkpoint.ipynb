    "## Introduction\n",
    "> This analysis focuses on examining the **No-Show appointments** data from Kaggle. In the dataset, about 100,000 medical appointment records from Brazil have been featured. The information captured in the dataset include the patient's **id, Appointment Id, Gender, ScheduledDay, AppointmentDay, Age, Neighbourhood, Scholarship, Hipertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism, Handcap, SMS_received, No-show**\n",
    "> ### Definition of important variables.\n",
    ">> _Gender_: Describes whether the patient is **male** or **female**. <br>\n",
    ">> _ScheduledDay_: Tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment. <br>\n",
    ">> _Age_: Indicates the patients age. <br>\n",
    ">> _Neighbourhood_: Indicates the location of the hospital. <br>\n",
    ">> _Scholarship_: Indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família. <br>\n",
    ">> _Hipertension_: Indicates whether a patient has Hipertension or not <br>\n",
    ">> _Diabetes_: Indicates whether a patient is diabetic or not. <br>\n",
    ">> _Alcoholism_: Indicates whether a patient alcoholic or not. <br>\n",
    ">> _Handcap_: Indicates whether a patient is Handcapped or not. <br>\n",
    ">> _SMS_received_: Indicates whether a patient received sms notifications about the appointment or not. <br>\n",
    ">> _No-show_: Indicates whether a patient showed up for their appointment or not. <br>\n",
    ">>> #### Important Points to Note:\n",
    ">>>> 1. For the _Scholarship_, _Hipertension_, _Diabetes_, _Alcoholism_, _Handcap_, and _SMS_received_ fields, **1 = Yes** and **0 = No**\n",
    ">>>> 2. For the _No-show_ field, **No = The patient showed up for the appointment** and **yes = The patient did not show up for the appointment**\n",
    "> ### Questions to be answered.\n",
    ">> Q1: Do patients of particular age groups book appointments more frequently than others? <br>\n",
    ">> Q2: Are male patients more likely to show up for an appointment as compared to female patients? <br>\n",
    ">> Q3: Are older patients more likely to show up for an appointment as compared to the younger patients? <br>\n",
    ">> Q4: How do patients from different neighbourhoods differ in terms of showing up for doctor's appointments? <br>\n",
    ">> Q5: Are patients who are enrolled in Brasilian welfare program more likely to show up for scheduled appointments? <br>\n",
    ">> Q6: How do positive diagnosis of health conditions such as hipertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism, and Handcap affect appointment attendance? <br>"
